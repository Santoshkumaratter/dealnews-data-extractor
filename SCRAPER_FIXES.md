# DealNews Scraper Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 403 Forbidden Errors
- **Problem**: Websites like nflshop.com were blocking requests with 403 errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved user agent rotation with multiple realistic browser user agents
  - Enhanced middleware to handle 403 errors by rotating user agents
  - Added better headers to mimic real browser requests

### 2. 404 Not Found Errors  
- **Problem**: Invalid URLs like `/cat/Computers/Laptops/` were causing 404 errors
- **Solution**:
  - Added URL validation method `is_valid_dealnews_url()` to filter out invalid URLs
  - Enhanced error handling to skip 404 errors instead of retrying
  - Added response status checking in the main parse method

### 3. Timeout Issues
- **Problem**: Many requests were timing out due to aggressive settings
- **Solution**:
  - Increased download delays from 0.5s to 1.0s
  - Increased autothrottle delays (start: 2s, max: 15s)
  - Reduced concurrency from 2.0 to 1.5
  - Added better timeout handling

### 4. Error Handling Improvements
- **Problem**: Poor error handling for HTTP status codes
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced middleware to handle 403, 404, and 429 errors appropriately
  - Added proper HTTP error codes to allowed list
  - Improved retry logic for different error types

```bash
scrapy crawl dealnews
```

## Expected Improvements

1. **Reduced 403 Errors**: User agent rotation should reduce blocking
2. **Eliminated 404 Errors**: URL validation prevents invalid URL requests
3. **Better Reliability**: Improved timeouts and error handling
4. **Cleaner Logs**: Better error messages and handling

## Monitoring

Watch the logs for:
- ✅ Reduced 403/404 errors
- ✅ Better success rates
- ✅ Cleaner error messages
- ✅ Successful deal extraction

## Notes

- The scraper now runs slower but more reliably
- Proxy support is available but disabled by default
- Error handling is more robust
- URL validation prevents many common issues
