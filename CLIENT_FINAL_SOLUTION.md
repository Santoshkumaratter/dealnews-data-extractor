# DealNews Scraper - Final Solution

## Problem Solved: Scraper Now Works Without MySQL

After extensive debugging and testing, we've identified and fixed the core issues with the DealNews scraper. The main problem was that the scraper was failing because it couldn't connect to MySQL, but now it gracefully handles this situation.

## What's Working Now:

1. ✅ **Scraper runs successfully** without requiring MySQL
2. ✅ **Data is exported** to JSON and CSV files
3. ✅ **Real deals are extracted** from DealNews.com
4. ✅ **Navigation items are filtered out**
5. ✅ **Clean exports** are generated for analysis

## How to Use the Scraper:

### Option 1: Run Without MySQL (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Make sure MySQL is disabled in .env
cd /Users/apple/Documents/dealnews-data-extractor
cp .env-template .env
echo "DISABLE_MYSQL=true" >> .env

# 2. Run the scraper
python3 run.py

# 3. Clean the exports (removes navigation items)
python3 fix_export.py
```

### Option 2: Run With MySQL (If Available)

```bash
# 1. Start MySQL server
# (Use your preferred method to start MySQL)

# 2. Configure .env
cd /Users/apple/Documents/dealnews-data-extractor
cp .env-template .env
echo "MYSQL_HOST=localhost" >> .env
echo "MYSQL_PORT=3306" >> .env
echo "MYSQL_USER=root" >> .env
echo "MYSQL_PASSWORD=root" >> .env
echo "MYSQL_DATABASE=dealnews" >> .env
echo "DISABLE_MYSQL=false" >> .env

# 3. Run the scraper
python3 run.py
```

## Output Files:

After running the scraper, you'll find these files:

- **Raw exports**: `exports/deals.json` and `exports/deals.csv`
- **Clean exports**: `exports/clean_deals_*.json` and `exports/clean_deals_*.csv`

The clean exports contain only real deals, with navigation items and empty entries removed.

## Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any issues:

1. **MySQL Connection Errors**: The scraper will automatically disable MySQL and continue with JSON/CSV export.

2. **JSON Export Errors**: Run `python3 fix_export.py` to clean and fix the exports.

3. **No Data in Exports**: Check your internet connection and try running with `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` in .env for more detailed logs.

## Summary of Changes:

1. Modified `run.py` to gracefully handle MySQL connection failures
2. Created `fix_mysql.py` to diagnose and fix database connection issues
3. Created `fix_export.py` to clean the exported data
4. Updated environment handling to properly disable MySQL when not available
5. Added better error handling throughout the codebase

These changes ensure the scraper works reliably even without a MySQL database, providing clean exports for analysis.
